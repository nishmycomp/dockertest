# Worker Restart Issue - Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### Modified: `docker/docker-compose-queue.yml`

**For both `pdf-worker-1` and `pdf-worker-2`:**

#### 1. Added Shared Memory
```yaml
shm_size: '1gb'  # NEW - Required for Chromium/Puppeteer
```
**Why**: Chromium needs shared memory (`/dev/shm`) to run properly. Without this, it crashes frequently.

#### 2. Increased Memory Limits
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 4G      # Changed from 2G
    reservations:
      memory: 1G      # Changed from 512M
```
**Why**: PDF generation with Puppeteer can use significant memory, especially when processing multiple jobs.

#### 3. Removed Code Volume Mount
```yaml
volumes:
  # - ./pdf-service:/app  # REMOVED
  - pdf_storage:/app/storage  # Kept only storage
```
**Why**: Mounting code as a volume can cause Node.js to crash when files change. Now code is baked into the image.

#### 4. Added Puppeteer Path
```yaml
environment:
  - PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium-browser  # NEW
```
**Why**: Ensures workers use the correct Chromium binary.

## What This Fixes

### Before:
```
âœ… Worker processes 1 job
ðŸ“¡ Received SIGTERM
ðŸ›‘ Worker stops
âœ… Worker restarts
âœ… Worker processes 1 job
ðŸ“¡ Received SIGTERM
ðŸ›‘ Worker stops
[Cycle repeats]
```

### After:
```
âœ… Worker processes job 1
âœ… Worker processes job 2
âœ… Worker processes job 3
âœ… Worker processes job 4
[Continues indefinitely]
```

## Deployment Steps

### On Your Local Machine:

1. **Commit and push changes:**
```bash
git add docker/docker-compose-queue.yml
git add docker/deploy-worker-fix.sh
git add docker/diagnose-worker-issues.sh
git add docker/WORKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
git add docker/WORKER_FIX_SUMMARY.md
git commit -m "Fix worker restart issue - add shared memory and increase limits"
git push
```

### On AlmaLinux Server (62.72.57.236):

2. **Pull latest changes:**
```bash
ssh root@62.72.57.236
cd /root/docker
git pull
```

3. **Run deployment script:**
```bash
chmod +x deploy-worker-fix.sh
./deploy-worker-fix.sh
```

**OR manually:**
```bash
cd /root/docker
docker compose -f docker-compose-queue.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose-queue.yml build --no-cache pdf-worker-1 pdf-worker-2
docker compose -f docker-compose-queue.yml up -d
```

4. **Verify workers are running:**
```bash
docker logs -f pdf-worker-1
```

You should see:
```
ðŸš€ PDF Worker started: worker-1-xxxx
ðŸ”„ Worker is running and processing jobs...
âœ… Browser initialized for PDF generation
ðŸ“§ Sending email for tenant...
âœ… Email sent successfully
ðŸ“§ Sending email for tenant...
âœ… Email sent successfully
[Continues without SIGTERM]
```

## Testing

### Send Test Emails:
```bash
# From Laravel app - send multiple invoices
# Workers should process all of them without restarting
```

### Monitor Queue:
```bash
# Check queue stats
curl http://localhost:3004/api/stats | python3 -m json.tool

# Check Redis directly
docker exec pdf-redis redis-cli llen bull:app.imploy.com.au:email:waiting
docker exec pdf-redis redis-cli llen bull:app.imploy.com.au:email:active
```

### Watch Workers:
```bash
# Watch both workers
docker logs -f pdf-worker-1 pdf-worker-2 2>&1 | grep "ðŸ“§\|âœ…"
```

## Files Created/Modified

1. âœ… `docker/docker-compose-queue.yml` - **MODIFIED** - Main fix
2. âœ… `docker/deploy-worker-fix.sh` - **NEW** - Deployment script
3. âœ… `docker/diagnose-worker-issues.sh` - **NEW** - Diagnostic tool
4. âœ… `docker/WORKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - **NEW** - Full guide
5. âœ… `docker/WORKER_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - **NEW** - This file
6. âœ… `docker/fix-worker-restart-issue.sh` - **NEW** - Quick fix
7. âœ… `docker/pdf-service/templates/invoice-template.hbs` - **MODIFIED** - Updated PDF template
8. âœ… `docker/pdf-service/email-service.js` - **MODIFIED** - Added formatNumber helper

## Expected Results

- âœ… Workers process jobs continuously without restarting
- âœ… No more SIGTERM signals after each job
- âœ… Queue drains properly
- âœ… Emails send successfully
- âœ… PDFs generate without crashes

## Rollback (If Needed)

If something goes wrong:

```bash
cd /root/docker
git checkout HEAD~1 docker/docker-compose-queue.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose-queue.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose-queue.yml up -d
```

## Notes

- Workers no longer have live code reload (need rebuild for code changes)
- This is more stable for production
- Memory usage will be higher but within limits
- Chromium will be more stable with dedicated shared memory

## Support

If workers still restart:
1. Run `bash docker/diagnose-worker-issues.sh`
2. Check `docker/WORKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
3. Review logs: `docker logs pdf-worker-1 --tail=100`
